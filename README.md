> Molly is a hardened version of [Signal](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android) for Android, the fast simple yet secure messaging app by [Signal Foundation](https://signal.org).

## Introduction

Back in 2018, Signal allowed the user to set a passphrase to secure the local message database. But this option was removed with the introduction of file-based encryption on Android. Molly brings it back again with additional security features.

Molly connects to the Signal server, so you can chat with your Signal contacts seamlessly. Please remember to review their [Signal Terms & Privacy Policy](https://signal.org/legal/) before signing up.

Every two weeks Molly is updated to include the latest features and bug fixes from Signal.

## Download

You can download the app from GitHub's [Releases](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/releases/latest) page or install it from the [Molly F-Droid Repo](https://molly.im/fdroid/):

There are two flavors to choose from download: **Molly** or **Molly-FOSS**. Learn the differences [below](#free-and-open-source) and download the right one for you.

Pre-releases are also available to download for development or beta testing.

## Features

Molly has unique features compared to Signal:

- Protects database with [passphrase encryption](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/wiki/Data-Encryption-At-Rest)
- Locks down the app automatically
- Securely shreds sensitive data from RAM
- Permits to block unknown senders
- Allows you to delete contacts and stop sharing your profile
- Clears call notifications together with expiring messages
- Disables debug logs
- Supports SOCKS proxy and Tor via Orbot

Besides that, you will find all the features of Signal plus some minor tweaks and improvements. The only exception is the SMS integration, that is incompatible with Molly security enhancements.

## Free and Open-Source

Molly is open-source just like Signal. But both apps use Google's proprietary code to support some key features. Molly-FOSS is the community effort to make it 100% free and open-source.

You can install the Molly flavor of your choice at any time, and it will replace any previously installed version. The data and settings will be preserved so that you do not have to re-register.

This table lists the current status of the dependencies:

| Feature                                | Molly-FOSS | Molly            | Signal          |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Push notifications <sup>(1)</sup>      | ✘          | ⚠️ (FCM)         | ⚠ (FCM)         |
| Websocket notifications <sup>(2)</sup> | ✔️          | ✔️               | ✔️               |
| Location provider                      | ✘          | ⚠ (Google Maps) | ⚠ (Google Maps) |

<sup>(1)</sup> If you are running a custom ROM and the app fails to register with Play Services, try the FOSS flavor.<br/>
<sup>(2)</sup> You may need to disable the system battery optimizations to receive notifications in background.

## Compatibility with Signal

Molly and Signal apps can be installed on the same device. If you need a 2nd number to chat, you can use Molly along with Signal.

However, you cannot use the same phone number on both apps at the same time. Only the last app to register will remain active, and the other will go offline. Remember that you are not limited to use only your main phone number, but also any number on you can receive SMS or phone calls at registration.

## Backups

Backups are fully compatible. Signal [backups](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059752-Backup-and-Restore-Messages) can be restored in Molly, and the other way around, simply by choosing the backup folder and file.

For older versions of Android, you might need to rename the backup file and copy it into the expected path, so the app can find the backup to restore during installation. Those are the locations within internal storage where backups are written by default:
- `Signal/Backups/Signal-year-month-date-time.backup`
- `Molly/Backups/Molly-year-month-date-time.backup`
